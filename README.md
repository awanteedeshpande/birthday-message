# A cool birthday gift for progammers

## About
My friend is a huge Linux lover, like all hardcore programmers. I decided to make a highly unique, customised birthday gift for him. The program goes through different messages and linux-specific clues he had to solve to continue, and the ultimate gift was a video I made for him, which I displayed at the end!

## Directory structure
* main.py - Run this file to start the program
* helper_functions - Functions that print messages, show the clues, and other cool things ;) 

## How the code works
Simply run ``python main.py`` in the terminal. All the necessary packages required should automatically download, as long as you have pip installed. The text, code, ascii art, image (and especially the clues) can be largely customised for anyone you want to run this for. <br/>
Initially a "hello" message is printed, followed by the list of clues to solve, and finally the program ends with the link you can display for the video or any other content created.

## Requirements
- python 3+
- pip </br>
Everything else should be automatically installed on running the program.
